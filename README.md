When I first opened up Spim to do assembler programming for the first time I was exhilarated. Then I had so much fun that I wanted to make my own emulator for the world to enjoy. I did not implemet any existing architecture but instead invented my own (sigh). Here is the result.

Here is a binary compiled for debian 64bit. If it doesn't work you'll have to pull the repository, install GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler), and do "ghc Main.hs" in the repository. That will result in a file called Main that can execute assembler source files.

This is more or less a student project thus far.
